Wow! That blew my mind!

How can you say that?

- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more

It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1,140p
25,29c
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!
And it's hard to make it!

Stop! Security.

It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show

1,140p
53,60c
- Flowers.
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
Security will be tight.

81,84c
We do not.
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?
The bees!

86,93c
is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.

1,140p
25,32c
- This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
Help me!

Wait for my signal.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous

And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

- Is that another bee joke?
- No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,

Not good. Does anyone onboard

He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.

I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
- You almost done?
- Almost.
.
142,147c
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?!

- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

1,147p
42,52c
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

Work through it like any emotion:
Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.

What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?

that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

All the honey

Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

We have a bit of bad weather

It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers

I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
Be careful.

Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory.

81,87c
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered

Where are you?

Affirmative.
That was on the line!

Yeah.

He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, "Watermelon?

Why would I marry a watermelon?"
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.

what hit them. And now

To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

1,147p
19,28c
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Bees?
Specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
That's our whole SAT test right there.

From what I understand,

50,58c
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

130,135c
You decide what you're interested in?

One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
One's bald, one's in a boat,

110,115c
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

Oh, yeah?
What's going on? Where is everybody?

- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.
You had your "experience." Now you

127,134c
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.

I would have to negotiate

How do you like the smell of flames?!

All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,

The court finds in favor of the bees!

Sorry.

All the honey

Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Oan I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

Yeah.
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
.
36,42c
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?

Thinking bee!

Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Bees must hate those fake things!

We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny

No. All right, I've got one.

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,

Anyway...
Oan I...

- For people. We eat it.
You don't have
enough food of your own?
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?
- Bees make it.

And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring.

Hey, Hector.
- You almost done?
.
1,361p
250,250c
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.

Barry!
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

I've made it worse.
.
243,248c

Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
What do we do now?

I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

What is that?

I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.

Did you bring your crazy straw?

bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always,

332,340c
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.

Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery

We would like to call

Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.

chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

330,335c
That was a little weird.

So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
