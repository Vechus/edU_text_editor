At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
That's our Barry.
- They're home.
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
You kick a wall, take a walk,
write an angry letter and throw it out.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
- They're home.

Restroom attendant's open,
Thank you. It was a gift.
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway...
Oan I...

- Like what?
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...

So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
- Bee-men.
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
Bees have good qualities.
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

You did? Was she Bee-ish?
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
and as a result,
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
Well, I met someone.
