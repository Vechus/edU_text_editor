What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
All adrenaline and then...

All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Oool.
