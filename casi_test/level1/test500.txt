The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

That's why I want to get bees

you not only take everything we have

Hey, what are you doing?!
Then all we do

Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
