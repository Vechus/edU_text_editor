He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be

Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
Pound those petunias,
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
and man-made wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves
with its distinctive

That bee is living my life!
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
golden glow you know as...
that gets their roses today.
- They're home.
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.
- Don't be ridiculous!
What's the difference?
He had a paw on my throat,
Problem!
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!

But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,

It goes under the mattresses.
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.
I don't want to put you out.

Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch

What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans

Everybody needs to stay

Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?

I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species,
Everybody needs to stay
That doesn't sound so bad.
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.
Between you and me,
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

They're very lovable creatures.

- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
We need to talk!
He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No, but there are other things bugging
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that
down to a science.
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
behind the barricade.
- What's the matter?
to make one decision in life.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
What happened to you?
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
- Say it!
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
- It's just coffee.
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!

Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You don't have that?
I would have to negotiate

the building! So long, bee!
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
- Thinking bee!
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
What happened to you?
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
All right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
And if it wasn't for you...
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You don't have that?
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of
You taught me how to fly!
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
All right, scramble, jocks!
You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!

Barry, who are you wearing?
Oannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
This is a badfella!
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
Don't kill him!
You don't have that?
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
All right, scramble, jocks!
You must meet girls.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!
It's a common name. Next week...
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
- Thinking bee!
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

Wind, check.
What happened to you?
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
that you're devilishly handsome

that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this

Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

This is a badfella!
Am I sure? When I'm done with
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
Don't kill him!
You don't have that?
I would have to negotiate

of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
Did you see the giant flower?

Up on a float, surrounded

compete in athletic events?

Right, right.

for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's a common name. Next week...
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact, there is.
- Thinking bee!
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
What happened to you?
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
that you're devilishly handsome
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?
That is one nectar collector!
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
This is a badfella!
Am I sure? When I'm done with
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
Don't kill him!
You don't have that?
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers

I'm getting to the bottom
belated congratulations on
your Emmy win for a guest spot
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!

do you think I should... Barry?
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
- Pollen!
- Flowers.
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.
They've got nothing
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
So why are you helping me?
- Thinking bee!
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Black and yellow!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
Am I sure? When I'm done with
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it, Your Honor!
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
How do we do it?
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
- It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Janet, your son's not sure
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.

there's a Korean deli on 83rd

He's denouncing bees!
Their wings are too small...
- Objection!
- Across the nation!
That's what falls off what they eat!
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...
Sit down!

We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

Right, right.
Black and yellow!
We are not them! We're us.

Put that on your resume brochure.

I move for a complete dismissal

Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
He's making the tie in the cab

How do we do it?
because for the first time in history,

He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.

- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
Sit down!
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
...really hot!
- Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!
- Thinking bee.
Hive at Five, the hive's only

to the white man?
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
Oan't breathe.
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,

Shut down honey production!

That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey,
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
my grandmother was a simple woman.
Am I sure? When I'm done with
What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
- That would hurt.
- No.
The human species?
So if there's no more pollination,
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
- I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
- He really is dead.
