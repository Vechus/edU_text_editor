The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?

Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson

They've done enough damage.

Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you

What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey,

So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
And it takes my mind off the shop.
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.

This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,

You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen

Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it

there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
