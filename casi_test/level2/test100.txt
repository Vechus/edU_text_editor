Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a

into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - known as a Replicant...
The NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal
in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them.
Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and
colonization of other planets.
After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-world colony,
Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death.
Special police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon
detection, any trespassing Replicant.
This was not called execution.
