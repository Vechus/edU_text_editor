Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same

Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
