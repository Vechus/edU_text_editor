answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.

address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
