For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
renovated vitality.
His justifications?
As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life
at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew
that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part
of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed
in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative
during somnolence.
What did he fear?
The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the
light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in
the cerebral convolutions.
What were habitually his final meditations?
