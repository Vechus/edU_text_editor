How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a

knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
ignorant lapse.
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty

disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
