make strong tea, don't you?
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's
wheedling voice:
--When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
makes water I makes water.
--By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled

He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.
Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I
look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any

the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest
squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me,
I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father
Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried
Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a

Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
--Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
--I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
west, sir?
--I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
--He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish
in Ireland.
--Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the
