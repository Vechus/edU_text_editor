Why solitary (ipsorelative)?

Why mutable (aliorelative)?
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From

What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged

    KOLOD BALEJWAW PNIMAH

Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?
By a periphrastic version of the general text.
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
